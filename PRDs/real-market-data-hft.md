## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the requirements for implementing real-time market data integration with the Colin Trading Bot's High-Frequency Trading (HFT) engine. The system will connect to live cryptocurrency exchanges to fetch real-time order book data, enabling production-ready HFT signal generation with actual market conditions rather than simulated data.

### 1.1 Business Objectives
- Transform the HFT system from demonstration to production-ready trading platform
- Enable real-time market microstructure analysis using live order book data
- Provide accurate trading signals based on actual market conditions
- Establish reliable data pipelines from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges
- Create comprehensive signal evaluation framework for informed trading decisions

### 1.2 Success Criteria
- Achieve >99% data connectivity uptime across multiple exchanges
- Maintain sub-100ms latency for order book updates
- Generate HFT signals with real-time market data
- Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Provide comprehensive signal analysis and evaluation tools

## 2. Problem Statement

The current HFT system operates with mock/simulated data, which limits its practical utility for actual trading decisions. While the algorithms are validated, the system lacks:

1. **Real Market Context**: No connection to live market conditions
2. **Accurate Signal Generation**: Signals based on artificial data rather than real supply/demand dynamics
3. **Production Readiness**: Missing components for live trading deployment
