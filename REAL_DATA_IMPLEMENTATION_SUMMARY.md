## 🔍 **TRADING SIGNAL EVALUATION FRAMEWORK**

### 📊 **How to Properly Evaluate Trading Signals**

#### **1. Confidence Level Assessment**
- **HIGH (>75%)**: Strong signals with higher success probability
- **MEDIUM (60-75%)**: Moderate signals - use with caution
- **LOW (<60%)**: Weak signals - avoid trading

#### **2. Risk Assessment**
- **LOW RISK**: Favorable conditions, higher position sizes possible
- **MEDIUM RISK**: Normal conditions, standard position sizing
- **HIGH RISK**: Unfavorable conditions, reduce or avoid trading

#### **3. Market Context Analysis**
- **TRENDING**: Best for directional signals
- **RANGING**: Be cautious with directional bets
- **VOLATILE**: Higher risk, smaller positions

#### **4. Signal Consistency Check**
- **CONSISTENT**: OFI and book skew agree = stronger signal
- **CONFLICTING**: Components disagree = weaker signal
- **NEUTRAL**: Mixed signals = avoid trading

#### **5. Position Sizing Guidelines**
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE + LOW RISK**: Full position size
- **MEDIUM CONDITIONS**: 50-75% position size
- **LOW CONFIDENCE + HIGH RISK**: 25% or less position size

#### **6. Risk Management Rules**
- **ALWAYS** use stop losses (2-3% maximum)
- **SET** take profit targets (5-10% recommended)
- **DIVERSIFY** across multiple signals/timeframes
- **NEVER** risk more than 1-2% per trade

## 🚨 **CRITICAL TRADING WARNINGS**

### **⚠️ NEVER Make Trading Decisions Based Solely on:**
1. **Mock/Demo Data**: The system uses simulated data for demonstration
2. **Single Signals**: Always use multiple confirmation sources
3. **High Confidence Alone**: Consider market context and risk factors
4. **Past Performance**: Historical results don't guarantee future success

### **✅ ALWAYS Follow These Guidelines:**
1. **Conduct Your Own Research**: Analyze market fundamentals and technicals
2. **Use Position Sizing**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
3. **Implement Stop Losses**: Always protect against downside risk
4. **Diversify Portfolio**: Spread risk across different assets
5. **Keep Trading Journal**: Track decisions and learn from results
6. **Stay Emotionally Disciplined**: Avoid fear and greed-based decisions
7. **Start Small**: Begin with small positions and scale gradually
8. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on market developments

## 🔧 **HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM**

### **For Testing and Learning:**
