### Project Requirements Proposal (PRP): "PsycheSignal" - A Free, Data-Aggregated Market Psychology & Order Flow Analyzer

**1. Project Vision**
To build a free, open-source trading assistant that provides users with a quantified "Market Psychology Score" (1-100) and answers natural language questions about order flow, support/resistance, and market structure for assets like ETH. The system will achieve this by intelligently aggregating data from free, public APIs, reverse-engineering the core data principles of platforms like LunarCrush and Nansen AI without their premium costs.

**2. Core Problem Statement**
Retail traders lack a consolidated, free view of market sentiment and on-chain/flow dynamics. They are forced to manually check multiple dashboards (social sentiment, on-chain flows, order books) to form a thesis. PsycheSignal will automate this synthesis.

**3. Key Features & Capabilities**

*   **Market Psychology Score (1-100):** A composite index that quantifies the overall market sentiment, from "Extreme Fear" to "Extreme Greed," inspired by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index but built on our own aggregated data streams .
*   **Natural Language Query Interface:** Users can ask questions like: *"Using OI, CVD, volume, order flow, and order book metrics, is the order flow for ETH weak right now? Where is support and where is the sell wall?"*
*   **Automated Data-Driven Answers:** The bot will parse the query, fetch relevant data, and generate a concise, factual response with key levels and a sentiment conclusion.

**4. Data Aggregation Strategy (The MVP Foundation)**

To keep the product free, we will leverage a combination of open-source libraries and free-tier APIs, directly addressing the core data needs:

*   **Social Sentiment (LunarCrush Alternative):**
    *   **Primary Source:** Use the unofficial `LunarCrushAPI` Python wrapper, which can access LunarCrush v2 data without an API key . This provides Galio Score, social volume, and sentiment.
    *   **Fallback/Supplement:** Integrate free social data from platforms like Santiment (if a free tier exists) or use a free-tier Google Gemini API for basic social media trend analysis .

*   **On-Chain & Wallet Intelligence (Nansen AI Alternative):**
    *   **Primary Source:** Utilize **Dune Analytics** and **Glassnode** as free alternatives. Dune allows for custom on-chain queries (e.g., exchange netflow, large transaction counts) [[12], [48]]. Glassnode offers a suite of free on-chain metrics like NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) and MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) which are strong sentiment indicators [[49], [53]].
    *   **Supplement:** Use **DeBank** for free portfolio and protocol interaction data .

*   **Order Flow, Order Book, OI, and CVD:**
    *   **Primary Source:** Leverage **exchange-specific APIs** (e.g., Binance for Open Interest ) and **free market data APIs**.
    *   **Key Data Providers:**
        *   **Tardis.dev:** Offers a free tier for historical tick-level order book and trade data, which is essential for calculating Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) and visualizing liquidity [[25], [40]].
        *   **CoinAPI.io:** Provides a free tier for aggregated market data, including order books and trades from multiple exchanges [[22], [46]].
        *   **Free Crypto Market Data (GitHub):** A simple, open-source API for basic quote and market data [[27], [38]].

**5. Technical Architecture (MVP)**

*   **Core Framework:** Build on an existing, robust open-source trading bot framework like **Hummingbot** or **Freqtrade** to handle exchange connectivity, data ingestion, and basic bot structure [[28], [30]].
*   **Data Ingestion Layer:** A Python module that orchestrates calls to the various free APIs (LunarCrush, Dune, Glassnode, Tardis, Binance, etc.) on a scheduled basis.
*   **Analysis & Scoring Engine:** A module that:
    1.  Normalizes data from disparate sources.
    2.  Calculates the **Market Psychology Score** by weighting and combining key metrics (e.g., Social Sentiment, NUPL, Exchange Netflow, Funding Rates, OI change).
    3.  Identifies key price levels (support/resistance) by analyzing order book liquidity clusters and psychological round numbers [[63], [65]].
*   **Query Interface:** A simple CLI or a basic web UI where users can input their natural language questions.
*   **Response Generator:** A lightweight AI component (using a free-tier LLM like Google Gemini) that takes the user's query, the pre-fetched and analyzed data from the engine, and formats a coherent, data-backed answer.

**6. Production & Monetization**

*   **Cost:** The MVP will be **completely free** by relying solely on the free tiers and open-source tools listed above. The primary cost will be server hosting, which can be mitigated by using a personal machine or a low-cost cloud instance for personal use.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to be modular. If user demand grows, premium API tiers can be added as optional, paid features, but the core free version will always remain available.

**7. Reverse-Engineering Summary**

*   **LunarCrush:** We replicate its social sentiment aggregation by using its unofficial free API and supplementing with other free social data sources.
*   **Nansen AI:** We replicate its on-chain intelligence by using free, powerful alternatives like Dune Analytics (for custom queries) and Glassnode (for standardized metrics), focusing on the most impactful, publicly available data points.

This PRP outlines a viable path to a production-ready, free trading assistant that delivers on the promise of aggregated market psychology and order flow analysis.
