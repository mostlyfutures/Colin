## ✅ **Revised Algorithmic Trading Bot Checklist (MUST-CODE)**

### 1. **Session Timing Logic (UTC-Based)**
Use precise, overlapping session windows to weight signal strength:
- **Asian Session**: **00:00 – 09:00 UTC** 
- **London Session**: **07:00 – 16:00 UTC** 
- **New York Session**: **12:00 – 22:00 UTC** (optional but useful) 

> 💡 **Bot Rule**: Increase trade confidence if entry aligns with **session open** (e.g., London open = higher volatility + institutional flow).

---

### 2. **Liquidation Heatmap (CoinGlass API)**
You **can** integrate this programmatically:
- CoinGlass offers **liquidation heatmap endpoints** that return price levels with high liquidation clusters .
- Use this to identify **"magnet zones"** where price is likely to sweep before reversing.

> 🛠️ **Implementation**:
> ```python
> # Pseudocode
> liquidation_levels = coinglass_api.get_liquidation_heatmap(symbol="ETHUSD")
> high_liquidation_zone = find_peak_density_zone(liquidation_levels)
> ```

> ⚠️ Note: Requires **CoinGlass API key** .

---

### 3. **Liquidity Zones (ICT → Algorithmic Translation)**
Instead of subjective "buy-side/sell-side liquidity," define:
- **Sell-side liquidity** = **recent swing highs** (e.g., highest high in last 4–24 hours)
- **Buy-side liquidity** = **recent swing lows** (e.g., lowest low in last 4–24 hours)
- Confirm with **volume profile**: high-volume nodes act as support/resistance .

> 🤖 **Bot Logic**: Only take longs if price is **below a major liquidity pool** and showing reversal signs (e.g., bullish engulfing + volume spike).

---

### 4. **Order Flow via Bookmap**
Bookmap **does offer API access** for custom strategies:
- The **Bookmap Connect API** allows integration of real-time order flow, liquidity depth, and heatmap data .
- You can build indicators or automated logic based on **delta divergence**, **liquidity voids**, or **absorption** .

> 🛠️ **Challenge**: Bookmap API is **not free** and requires exchange connectivity (Binance, Bybit, etc.) .

> ✅ **Alternative**: If Bookmap is cost-prohibitive, use **exchange-level order book APIs** (e.g., Binance depth stream) to approximate delta and liquidity.

---

### 5. **Open Interest (OI) & Volume**
Both are **readily available via exchange APIs**:
- **Binance**: `GET /fapi/v1/openInterest` 
- **Bybit**: Also provides OI and 24h volume endpoints 
- Use **OI change + price direction** to filter entries:
  - **Bullish confirmation**: Price ↑ + OI ↑ = new longs entering
  - **Bear trap**: Price ↓ + OI ↓ = longs capitulating (potential reversal)

> 📊 **Volume**: Require **above-average volume** on entry candle to confirm participation .

---

## 🧠 **Final Decision Engine (Bot Logic Flow)**

Before entering a trade, your bot should **pass all** of these checks:

| Condition | Check |
|--------|------|
| **1. Session** | Is current UTC time in Asian/London session? (↑ confidence) |
| **2. Liquidity Target** | Is price approaching a **high liquidation zone** (from CoinGlass) **or** recent swing high/low? |
| **3. Order Flow** | Is there **buying pressure** (positive delta) near support? (via Bookmap or order book) |
| **4. OI + Volume** | Is volume > 20-period avg? Is OI confirming trend direction? |
| **5. Risk Filter** | Is distance to nearest opposite liquidity zone > 1.5x risk? |

> ✅ Only if **≥4/5 conditions** are met → enter trade with predefined stop (below/above liquidity sweep).

## 🔌 **Tech Stack Recommendations**
- **Data**: CoinGlass (liquidations), Binance/Bybit (OI, volume, order book)
- **Order Flow**: Bookmap API (premium) **or** custom order book delta calculator
- **Backtesting**: Use `backtrader` or `freqtrade` with OHLCV + OI data
- **Execution**: CCXT library for cross-exchange order placement

- A sample **Python pseudocode structure**
- A **priority-ranked signal weighting system**
- Help **approximating Bookmap data** without the paid API

This plan turns your discretionary edge into a **scalable, testable algorithm**.
