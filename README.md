# Colin Trading Bot - Institutional-Grade Signal Scoring Bot

A sophisticated crypto perpetuals trading signal analysis system that incorporates institutional-grade market structure and order flow principles from the ICT (Institutional Candlestick Theory) framework and market microstructure research.

## 🏦 Overview

Colin Trading Bot generates real-time **Long/Short Confidence percentages** (0-100%) for crypto perpetuals by synthesizing:

- **Liquidity Dynamics**: Proximity to liquidation clusters and stop-hunt zones
- **ICT Market Structure**: Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), Order Blocks (OBs), Break of Structure (BOS)
- **Session Timing**: Killzone filters for Asian, London, and NY sessions
- **Order Flow Analysis**: Book imbalance and aggressive trade delta
- **Volume & Open Interest**: Confirmation from Binance Futures data

The output includes human-readable rationale based on smart money behavior patterns, not just generic technical indicators.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Institutional Signal Analysis
- **Liquidity Proximity Scoring**: Identifies proximity to high-density liquidation zones
- **ICT Structure Detection**: Algorithmic detection of FVGs, Order Blocks, and BOS
- **Killzone Timing**: Optimal entry windows during institutional session overlaps
- **Order Flow Analytics**: Real-time order book imbalance and trade delta analysis
- **Volume/OI Confirmation**: Correlates signals with volume and open interest trends

### 📊 Risk Management
- **Structural Stop-Loss Levels**: Based on ICT structures, not arbitrary percentages
- **Position Sizing**: Confidence-adjusted position sizing with volatility considerations
- **Risk/Reward Analysis**: Calculates optimal take-profit levels with 2:1 ratio targeting
