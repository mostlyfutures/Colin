The most effective high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithm to configure in your bot, based on your listed metrics, is a hybrid strategy utilizing real-time Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) models for position entry/exit, with configurable logic to react to book imbalances, open interest trends, liquidity zones, and global macro triggers  Core Algorithm Structure
* Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) Forecasting: Use engineered signals from order flow imbalance, calculated tick-by-tick from order book events, and forecast directionality using Hawkes processes or Vector Auto Regression to capture dependencies between buy and sell flows. 
* Order Book Skew & Bookmap Metrics: Integrate logic for real-time analysis of bid/ask depth imbalance (“book skew”), using Bookmap data streams or similar, including heatmap visualization metrics if available. 
* Liquidity Detection: Add modules to track buyside and sellside liquidity, flagging areas where price is likely to move rapidly due to thin liquidity or accumulation/distribution events. 
* Open Interest Trends: Incorporate dynamic thresholds on open interest changes and combine with delta order flow to anticipate large directional moves or reversals. 
* Macro/Global Events: Place risk-off logic and filter criteria using global news feeds that impact currencies, commodities, or major indices—triggering auto-halts or adapting aggressiveness based on time-sensitive events. 
* Time Zone Macros: Adjust trade frequency, risk exposure, and position limits based on active market hours (Asia, EU, US), or specific macro event windows. 
Example Configurable Logic
* Enter long if order flow imbalance, book skew, and increased open interest coincide, in a region of strong buyside liquidity.
* Exit or reverse when OFI signal reverses, bookmap heatmap thins, or global news risk-off event is flagged.
* Limit position size dynamically based on order book thickness and open interest volatility.
Recommended Implementation
* Use Python or C++ for ultra-fast execution, and Databento, Bookmap, or similar for real-time market data.
* For decision logic, see rule-based example (with book skew and position management) from Databento. 
* Augment with real-time news headlines (APIs like Bloomberg, Reuters), and use time zone logic to modulate trading intensity.
This algorithmic template is modular, adaptable to most asset classes (futures, FX, crypto), and can be tuned for your preferred metrics and trading style.

The most effective high frequency trading (HFT) algorithm for your trading bot should synthesize order book analytics, liquidity cues, time zone macros, and global news, using a rule-based or AI-enhanced framework designed for real-time action. For your specified metrics (Open Interest, Order Flow, Bookmap Metrics, Liquidity, Time Macros, and News), a proven approach is a hybrid order-flow-based, liquidity-taking strategy, ideally with modular integration for live news feeds and macro analysis.
HFT Strategy Design
* Order Book Skew & Imbalance: Use a rule-based method where the trade trigger is the difference in resting bid/ask depth, scaled logarithmically. For example, if log10(bid size) - log10(ask size) exceeds a threshold, trigger a buy; do the opposite for shorting. This logic acts on microstructure shifts and is highly effective for Bookmap-style metrics and order flow. 
* Liquidity & Open Interest: Integrate liquidity-taking strategies that act when large shifts in buy/sell liquidity pools or open interest are detected. These provide early signals for price shifts, which are essential for both buy-side and sell-side liquidity events. 
* Time Zone & Macros: Dynamically adjust algorithmic aggression/quantity sizing based on overlapping global session activity and macroeconomic calendars. For example, increase sensitivity during London/New York overlap or major GDP/news releases. 
* Global News Integration: Add an event-driven news module that parses real-time macro news feeds for keywords tied to currency and economic events. Upon release, the module can temporarily crank up the strategy’s risk or throttle exposure depending on news polarity and impact predictions. 
Open-Source Frameworks & Bots
* AI-Enhanced HFT (MT5 with ML signals): This open-source framework combines classical signals (EMA/ADX) with XGBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM models for predictive analytics, supporting both order book and macro/news inputs in Forex markets. 
* Hummingbot, Zenbot, 3Commas, Shrimpy: These top configurable trading bots allow you to inject both simple rule-based strategies and more complex, ML-based modules for news/macro adaptation. They are extensible and support real-time metrics, including order book analytics. 
* Databento/Interactive Brokers Template: Offers a full-featured sample in Python, with live order book data processing, position/risk capping, and easy integration for custom features (e.g., news triggers, global macro handling). 
Suggested Config Template (Python-Like Pseudocode)

text
if (log10(bid_size) - log10(ask_size)) > threshold and session_macro_active and positive_news_signal:
    place_buy_order()
elif (log10(bid_size) - log10(ask_size)) < -threshold and negative_news_signal:
    place_sell_order()

# Adjust thresholds/position sizing for overlapping time zones or imminent major news releases.

# Integrate open interest and liquidity depth as additional confirmation filters.
You can also tie in machine learning modules or natural language processing for live macro/news to make the strategy more responsive and adaptive.
Risk Management & Market Conditions
* Set hard position/risk limits in volatile or low liquidity periods to avoid unwanted liquidation or flash moves.
* Monitor order fragmentation and market stress; HFT strategies are most stable under normal liquidity conditions, but can exacerbate slippage or spread widening during market stress. 
Incorporating these elements will produce a robust, modular HFT bot centered on the exact metrics and market events you outlined, with the flexibility to plug in new data streams as your infrastructure scales.

“Recommend rule-based HFT algorithms suitable for these metrics” 
Rule-based HFT algorithms are well-suited for your focus on order book, order flow, liquidity, macro events, and related metrics. These strategies use explicit, deterministic rules to trigger trades, making them reliable and transparent in fast-moving markets.arxiv+2
Book Skew (Order Book Imbalance) Strategies
* A common and effective rule-based technique is the order book skew strategy, which triggers trades based on the real-time difference in resting bid and ask depth at the top of the book.
* The rule: Go long (buy) when the log-scaled bid depth minus ask depth exceeds a positive threshold, and go short (sell) when the value drops below a negative threshold.
* This method directly exploits imbalances and is highly responsive to shifts in book liquidity.interactivebrokers+1 
Liquidity-Taking Algorithms
* Liquidity-taking HFT strategies use rules such as: “Enter a market order when a sudden spike in available liquidity or a large order appears/disappears from the book.”
* Parameters can be adjusted based on time-of-day (time zone macros) or increased aggression around scheduled macroeconomic releases.interactivebrokers 
Order Book Filtration Schemes
* Rule-based filtration methods remove transient orders, frequent modifications, or suspiciously rapid quote changes, focusing on genuine trading intent.
* The logic applies real-time filters based on order lifetime, modification count, or inter-update delay, ensuring signals like order book imbalance are cleaner and less susceptible to market manipulation (e.g., spoofing).arxiv 
Event-Driven (Macro/News) Rules
* Event-based strategies parse global news and economic calendars. Pre-programmed rules can throttle order flow, halt trading, or systematically increase/reduce risk just before/after market-moving events.
* NLP-powered APIs can be integrated for instant sentiment or impact detection, but the triggering of the trade will still obey deterministic rules on news keyword, time, and market impact.ezalgo

# Add logic to increase threshold or pause trades during macro news windows.

Order Filtration for Signal	Exclude orders by life/mod/time modification	Cleaned order flow, OI, volume	News, spoof patterns
