### Key Insights on Tokenization Methodologies in Layer 1 Networks

- Research suggests that layer 1 (L1) networks are increasingly adopting modular architectures to enhance tokenization, allowing for specialized handling of real-world assets (RWAs) like treasuries, with features like high throughput and built-in compliance standards to support scalability and institutional use.
- Technical architectures often integrate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs for privacy, and permissioned controls, as seen in projects like Integra and Pharos, which aim to balance decentralization with regulatory needs.
- Comparative analyses indicate that while Ondo Finance offers a vertically integrated, SEC-regulated stack for end-to-end tokenization, frameworks like BlackRock's BUIDL and Franklin Templeton's FOBXX rely more on Ethereum's base layer, potentially limiting scalability but providing strong institutional backing.
- Desired practices emphasize groundbreaking scalability through sharding or rollups, institutional adoption via KYC/AML integrations, and privacy enhancements like selective disclosure, though challenges in interoperability and global regulations persist.

#### Technical Architectures Driving Innovation
Evidence leans toward L1 networks evolving beyond traditional monolithic designs to modular systems that separate consensus, execution, and data availability. For instance, networks like Avalanche and Polygon incorporate subnet or rollup-like structures to handle tokenization workloads efficiently, reducing congestion and enabling parallel processing for asset origination and distribution.

#### Comparative Landscape
Projects like Ondo stand out for owning the full stack, from origination to on-chain distribution, contrasting with BUIDL's reliance on third-party infrastructure for distribution. This integration may provide Ondo with a competitive edge in speed and cost, but larger players like BlackRock benefit from established trust and higher AUM.

#### Standards and Practices
It seems likely that standards such as ERC-3643 for compliant security tokens and ERC-1404 for transfer restrictions are becoming desired for institutional adoption, promoting privacy through whitelists and role-based access. Scalability practices include aiming for 50K+ TPS in modular L1s, while privacy focuses on ZK and encrypted rollups to protect sensitive financial data.

### Advancements in Tokenization Methodologies on Layer 1 Networks: Technical Architectures, Comparative Frameworks, and Evolving Standards

#### Introduction
Tokenization, the process of representing real-world assets (RWAs) such as treasuries, real estate, or commodities as digital tokens on a blockchain, has emerged as a transformative methodology in decentralized finance (DeFi). Layer 1 (L1) networks, which form the foundational blockchain layer handling consensus and security, are incorporating innovative features to support this. Driven by the need for efficiency in a projected $26 trillion treasury tokenization market, these methodologies focus on technical architectures that enable seamless asset origination, distribution, and trading. This paper explores new methodologies integrated into L1 networks, with an emphasis on technical architecture, as well as comparative analyses of frameworks like Ondo Finance against others such as BlackRock's BUIDL and Franklin Templeton's FOBXX. It also delves into standard and desired practices, prioritizing groundbreaking scalability, institutional adoption, and privacy.

The analysis draws from recent developments in 2025, where L1 networks are shifting toward specialized designs for RWAs. For example, networks like Ethereum continue to dominate due to their smart contract capabilities, but emerging L1s such as REAL, Integra, and Pharos introduce purpose-built architectures for tokenization. This evolution addresses limitations in traditional systems, such as high fees, slow settlement, and lack of privacy, while fostering institutional participation.

#### New Methodologies in Layer 1 Networks for Tokenization
L1 networks are adopting methodologies that enhance tokenization through advanced technical architectures. These include modular designs, interoperability protocols, and hybrid consensus mechanisms to handle the complexities of RWAs.

**Modular Architectures for Enhanced Flexibility**: A key methodology is modularity, where L1 networks separate core functions like execution, settlement, and data availability. This allows for customizable "subnets" or "rollups" tailored to tokenization needs. For instance, Avalanche's architecture supports multiple subnets, enabling isolated environments for asset tokenization with dedicated validators for compliance-sensitive operations. Similarly, the REAL blockchain, positioned as the first L1 specialized in RWAs, integrates business logic directly into its consensus layer, facilitating real-time tokenization of assets like treasuries with embedded regulatory checks. This modular approach contrasts with monolithic L1s like early Ethereum, offering better resource allocation for high-volume token transfers.

**Integration of IoT and Verifiable Data for Physical Asset Tokenization**: Emerging methodologies incorporate Internet of Things (IoT) data for grounding tokens in real-world verifiability. A proposed framework by the SEC outlines secure tokenization of physical assets using IoT sensors to feed tamper-proof data into the blockchain. On L1 networks, this manifests as oracle integrations or native data layers, ensuring tokens represent actual asset states (e.g., supply chain provenance). XRP Ledger exemplifies this with its decade-long stability in tokenizing crypto-native assets, extended to RWAs via decentralized identifiers.

**Hybrid Consensus and Execution Layers**: To support tokenization, L1s are blending proof-of-stake (PoS) with elements of proof-of-authority (PoA) for permissioned environments. Pharos Network, a modular L1, achieves up to 50K transactions per second (TPS) through sharding and sub-second finality, ideal for scalable tokenization. This methodology reduces latency in asset transfers, a critical upgrade from traditional L1s.

#### Technical Architecture Focus
The core of these methodologies lies in technical architectures that prioritize efficiency, security, and composability.

- **Execution Environments**: Many L1s maintain EVM compatibility for developer familiarity while adding tokenization-specific extensions. Integra Layer, built on Cosmos SDK, supports ERC-3643 and ERC-1404 standards for regulated tokenization, embedding KYC/AML protocols directly into the architecture. This allows for permissioned tokens where transfers respect jurisdictional rules, enhancing privacy through selective disclosure.

- **Data and Storage Layers**: Architectures incorporate off-chain data availability (DA) solutions to handle large-scale token metadata. For example, Polygon's AggLayer aggregates liquidity across chains, enabling composable tokens that interact seamlessly with traditional finance.

- **Security and Privacy Primitives**: ZK proofs are increasingly embedded for privacy-preserving tokenization. Ten Protocol uses encrypted rollups and trusted execution environments (TEEs) to hide transaction details while proving validity, addressing institutional concerns over data exposure.

| L1 Network | Key Architectural Feature | TPS/Scalability | Privacy Mechanism | Institutional Fit |
|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| REAL | Integrated RWA business logic in consensus | High (modular sharding) | Permissioned access controls | High, focused on $30T RWA market |
| Integra | Cosmos SDK + EVM, ERC-3643/1404 standards | Medium-high (interoperable bridges) | KYC/AML embedded, selective disclosure | Strong, for real estate tokenization |
| Pharos | Modular with edge compute orchestration | 50K TPS, sub-second finality | ZK coprocessors | Emerging, enterprise-grade scalability |
| Mavryk | Full-stack with native DeFi services | High (rollups) | Compliance-focused encryption | High, bridging TradFi and Web3 |
| XRP Ledger | Decentralized ledger with native token issuance | 1.5K TPS (scalable via sidechains) | Federated consensus for privacy | Established for cross-border assets |

#### Comparative Analysis of Emerging Tokenization Frameworks
Ondo Finance exemplifies vertical integration, acquiring broker-dealer licenses to control the entire stack from asset origination to on-chain distribution. With $600M AUM growing 300% annually, its architecture leverages Ethereum for token issuance but adds proprietary layers for SEC compliance, contrasting with BlackRock's BUIDL, which dominates with 40% market share ($2.9B AUM) via a tokenized treasury fund on Ethereum. BUIDL emphasizes stability and transparency but relies on third parties for distribution, unlike Ondo's end-to-end control.

Franklin Templeton's FOBXX, another Ethereum-based fund, focuses on government money markets but uses external infrastructure, limiting scalability compared to Ondo's integrated approach. Emerging L1s like RWA Asset Chain provide a backbone for global tokenization with gasless swaps and transparent architecture, offering broader interoperability than Ondo's DeFi-centric model.

| Framework | Technical Base | AUM/Market Share | Scalability | Privacy/Institutional Adoption | Strengths vs. Ondo |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Ondo Finance | Ethereum + proprietary stack | $600M, 300% growth | Medium (relies on L1 scaling) | High (SEC-regulated, vertical integration) | Full stack ownership; monopoly in treasury tokenization |
| BlackRock BUIDL | Ethereum | $2.9B, 40% share | High (L2 integrations) | Strong (compliance-focused, institutional trust) | Larger scale and credibility; but dependent on externals |
| Franklin Templeton FOBXX | Ethereum | N/A (emerging) | Medium | Medium-high (external infra for compliance) | Diversified portfolios; less integrated than Ondo |
| REAL L1 | Custom modular L1 | Emerging | High (business-integrated) | High (RWA-specific) | Native RWA focus; potentially more scalable than Ondo's Ethereum base |
| Integra Layer | Cosmos + EVM | Emerging | High (cross-chain) | High (built-in KYC) | Compliance emphasis; broader than Ondo's treasury niche |

#### Standard and Desired Practices for Tokenization
Standards are evolving to ensure scalability, institutional adoption, and privacy, with a focus on compliance-friendly designs.

**Groundbreaking Scalability Practices**: Desired practices include rollups and sharding for TPS exceeding 50K, as in Pharos, and cross-chain interoperability via protocols like Chainlink's CCIP. The World Economic Forum highlights real-time settlement and asset composability as standards unlocking efficiency.

**Institutional Adoption Practices**: Emphasis on technology-neutral regulations, as per OECD, with KYC/AML integrations and whitelists for permissioned access. Projects like Hedera prioritize high-throughput for enterprise tokenization.

**Privacy Practices**: Selective disclosure via ZK and TEEs is a desired standard, enabling confidential transactions while maintaining auditability. This balances decentralization with institutional data protection needs.

| Practice Area | Standard Examples | Desired Implementation | Challenges |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Scalability | Sharding, rollups | 50K+ TPS in modular L1s | Interoperability across chains |
| Institutional Adoption | ERC-3643, KYC/AML | Permissioned tokens, regulatory sandboxes | Global regulatory inconsistency |
| Privacy | ZK proofs, TEEs | Encrypted rollups, selective disclosure | Balancing transparency and confidentiality |

#### Conclusion
L1 networks are pioneering methodologies that integrate modular architectures with RWA-specific features, as evidenced by projects like REAL and Integra. Ondo's vertical integration sets a benchmark, but comparative frameworks highlight trade-offs in scalability and reliance on legacy infrastructure. Desired practices in scalability, adoption, and privacy will drive mainstream integration, though standardization remains key to overcoming barriers.
